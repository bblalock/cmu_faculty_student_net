There \\nare several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry \\nor disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy(variance) \\nin the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we \\ntackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual \\ninformation between the chosen locations and the locations which are not \\nselected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that \\nmaximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, \\nwe describe a polynomialtime approximation that is within (1 - 1/e) of \\nthe optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We \\nalso show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and \\ndesign branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm \\nto exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding \\nsignificant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements \\nwhich are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. \\nThese extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical \\napproximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective \\nfunction. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing \\nmutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two \\nreal-world data sets. \\n\\n\\n56 pages\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSCS Technical Report Collection\\nSchool of Computer Science homepage\\n\\nThis page maintained by reports@cs.cmu.edu\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'}"

To solve thisproblem, new technologies that can profile single-cells have been introduced in the last decade. Currently, studies attempt to construct lineage relationships using time-series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data or by utilizing artificial mutations for marking cells.  The former studies rely on pseudo-time ordering which suffers from shortcomings that can impact their accuracy.   The latter often apply phylogeny-based methods which often lead to hundreds of candidate trees. There is no current method to combine single-cell lineage trees from different individuals of the same organism to reconstruct a single invariant lineage for the same species.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this thesis, we present a set of machine learning models that  focus on reconstructing single-cell lineages. We developed a pro\\nbabilistic  model  based  on Continuous-State Hidden Markov Model (CSHMM) to reconstruct trajectories and branchings from time series scRNA-Seq data. The model is then extended by learning the dynamics of regulatory interactions that take place during the process being sutdied (CSHMM-TF). We next present a method that integrates sequence andxpression data. In addition, we developed LinTIMaT, a statistical model for reconstructing single-cell lineage trees using both artificial mutations and scRNA-Seq dataand for constructing a general invariant lineage tree from multiple cell lineage trees of the same species. Finally, we apply CSHMM to a new dataset and show that it is capable of reconstructing lineage relationships and provides important novel insights for studying lung development.\\n\\n\\n\\n209  pages\\n\\n\\nThesis Committee:\\nZiv Bar-Joseph (Chair)\\nRoni Rosenfeld \\nDarrell Kotton (Boston University)\\nKillian Hurley (Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland)\\n\\nRoni Rosenfeld, Head, Machine Learning Department\\nMartial Hebert, Dean, School of Computer Science\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSCS Technical Report Collection\\nSchool of Computer Science\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'}"
